# Hi, I'm Ezzaldeen Albitar 👋

### Software Engineering | MERN Stack Developer  



## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Software Engineering** graduate from **Mutah University**. I specialize in building full-stack web applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Currently, I am focused on strengthening my backend development and database management skills to build scalable, real-world applications.

I am passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and have experience developing everything from **authentication systems** and **RESTful APIs** to responsive front-end interfaces.
